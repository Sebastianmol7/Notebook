# Why I chose to take this course

I am majoring in Geography with a minor in History with the hopes of going to teacher's college and eventually teaching in a high school setting. I have wanted to teach since I graduated high school and read this quote:

I am taking this course because I believe the world is becoming increasingly more digital, and this course will provide me with resources and knowledge that I can use to incorporate digital learning into my classroom. Although I acknowledge that learning styles are evolving and changing all the time, I'm worried that we might rely too much on technology. I don't want my classroom to look like this:

In terms of digital experience... Well, I am not the most technologically inclined person. I don't own a laptop or a tablet, and do most of my work at home on my desktop after I get off of work. I don't find working with technology to be hard or overly frustrating, but I haven't really spent much time learning how to code or work with HTML. I'm hoping this class will help me develop some skills in that area.

I actually used to regularly update my own [blog] to follow my journey into the field of education. It was fun, but I got discouraged because of the lack of feedback I was getting. On top of that, I some experience in using scripts in [ArcGIS] and a very little bit of experience in [R] which I think will help me with the work in this class. The only thing I am worried about is keeping up with the [slack] group. I'm not the best at checking in with communication, especially when everytime I check in, so much seems to have gone by.
