<p> 4. Miscellaneous Observations.</p>
<p>A large proportion of all the estates are mortaged; and estates are frequently sold to pay off the debts upon them. The slaves themselves, too, or a part of them, are often seized for the payment of the master's debts; and this is done without any reference, in a multitude of cases, to family-connections. It is felt by them as a grievous hardship to be separated from their connections: it sometimes produces a species of rebellion; and has been known to occasion the death of many, through the distress of mind which it produces.</p>
<p>Small proprietors often undertake to do work on estates by job, which they employ their slaves to execute. When they are thus sent to different places, they carry their own provisions with them, and usually sleep on the ground under a tent all huddled together, though sometimes they are accommodated in the sugar-works of the estate, or by the Negroes of the estate in their houses.</p>
<p>Task-work is very uncommon in Jamaica. It is held to be dangerous to allow the slave much spare time.</p>
<p>If a Negro is deemed to be incorrigible by plantation-discipline, he is often sent to the workhouse of the parish, where he is chained to another Negro, and employed, with others chained in the same manner, two and two, in repairing the roads during the day, being shut up during the night. The punishment is inflicted without the intervention of any magistrate, by the mere desire of the master or overseer, who may protract it for any length of time. </p>
