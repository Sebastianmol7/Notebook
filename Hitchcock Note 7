Although the use of close reading has made much progress in the past fifteen years, Hitchcock states that we can still do more with it. To further this, Hitchcock examines a specific judicial case for a woman in the 19th century, comparing them with other cases at this time. He locates her case in relation to the rise of 'plea bargaining' and the new judicial system and punishments. This allows Hitchcock to understand her position, as she was young and confronted by a new system of law and policing, likely making it hard for her to understand or navigate.
